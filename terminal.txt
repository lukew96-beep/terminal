Terminal is a wrapper program that runs a shell. A shell is the program which
actually proccesses commands and returns outputs.
An absolute path is the path to a folder or file including all directories it 
takes to get there.
Relative path is the path to a folder or file within the directory it is in.
A flag is a special attribute of a command prompt. examples include ls -a which
will return a list including all files even if they are hidden. rm -r removes a 
directory instead of just a file. ls -1 returns a list with all files on one
line instead of a columb.
-f on the rm command will Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation
, regardless of the file's permissions.  If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify the
exit status to reflect an error.  The -f option overrides any previous -i options.
-r will Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument. The -R 
option implies the -d option.  If the -i option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation
before each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt is 
made to remove the directory). If the user does not respond affirmatively, 
the file hierarchy rooted in that directory is skipped.
